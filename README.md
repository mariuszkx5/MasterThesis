Date of thesis defense: 18/09/2019

Abstract:
Over time the number of renewable energy sources and new loads in
the distribution grids increases. Therefore, the topic of Smart Transformer
(ST) as a key element of the Smart Grids is becoming very popular. One
of the important elements of the ST design process is to create its entire
simulation model along with its complete control strategy. Unfortunately,
the construction of a switching model of the whole ST due to many switches
results in a huge complexity of calculations. Therefore, the main goal of
the thesis is to develop the ST average model which allows verifying the
considered topology of ST from the control point of view. As a result, the
average model the ST has been created and its correctness has been proved by
comparing the detailed model and the average model behaviour of individual
parts of the ST. The developed model has allowed to significant reduction in
simulation time which has made possible to analyse the behaviour of entire
ST with selected control algorithms.
